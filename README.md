# 🔍 Face Link Connect

## 🌟 Vision
**Face Link Connect** is a cutting-edge networking solution designed for professionals, social enthusiasts, and event planners who struggle with lost connections during events. Unlike traditional manual contact exchange methods, our product leverages facial recognition technology to facilitate seamless, swift, and error-free interactions.

> **Note:** This project is part of a broader initiative on **Product Development and Management**, focusing on real-world application and innovation in networking solutions.

## 🚀 Motivation

Meeting hundreds of candidates at events makes it challenging for hiring managers to remember and reconnect with the right talent. **Face Link Connect** streamlines post-event communication by providing an efficient alternative to handling numerous LinkedIn requests.

### 🎓 Graduate Students
International graduate students face additional hurdles in networking for job opportunities. **Face Link Connect** simplifies the connection process, helping students maintain important professional relationships beyond the event.
